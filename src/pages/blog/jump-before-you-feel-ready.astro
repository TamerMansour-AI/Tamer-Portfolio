    <article class="glass-card space-y-8 p-6 sm:p-8">
      <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-sand/85">
        There is a very specific kind of fear that only appears when life is “okay”. Not a disaster. Not a crisis. Just… okay.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-sand/85">
        You have a salary. A desk. A job title that sounds respectable at family dinners. You know exactly what next month looks like. And that is the problem.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-sand/85">
        For years, that was me. By day I was the “responsible adult” in an office in Ramallah, answering emails, managing tasks, and monitoring spreadsheets.
        By night I was the person I actually recognised: the one imagining films, visual projects, strange AI experiments, and stories rooted in Palestine.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-sand/85">
        I kept telling myself a familiar lie: “One day, when things calm down… when I have savings… when I’m ‘ready’… then I’ll fully commit to the work I
        actually care about.”
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-sand/85">That day never came on its own. I had to jump.</p>
      <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-sand/85">
        This is the story of that jump, and a few things I learned that might help you if you’re standing on your own edge, afraid but curious.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white">The Comfortable Cage</h2>
      <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-sand/85">If you looked at my life from the outside, it made sense.</p>
      <ul class="space-y-2 text-sm text-sand/85">
        <li>• A stable job with a big organisation.</li>
        <li>• Good at what I do.</li>
        <li>• A clear ladder I could climb slowly and safely.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-sand/85">Inside, it felt like a comfortable cage.</p>
      <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-sand/85">
        Every time I opened MidJourney or an AI video tool “just to play”, my brain lit up. Suddenly, hours disappeared.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-sand/85">
        I realised something important: my “hobby” was the only time my nervous system relaxed and my brain switched to curious mode instead of survival mode.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-sand/85">
        If there is one activity that makes time disappear and makes you feel more you, do not ignore that signal. That is not a hobby. That is a compass.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white">The Moment I Stopped Negotiating With Fear</h2>
      <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-sand/85">
        People imagine that big life decisions happen with violins playing in the background. For me it was simpler, and more annoying.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-sand/85">
        I was exhausted. I had reached a point where continuing the same loop felt more dangerous than leaving it.
      </p>
      <ul class="space-y-2 text-sm text-sand/85">
        <li>• The system I was in would not suddenly reward my creativity.</li>
        <li>• My energy after work would never be enough to build what I wanted on the side.</li>
        <li>• Waiting for “perfect timing” was just a polite form of self-sabotage.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-sand/85">
        So I did the unthinkable in our culture: I chose uncertainty over respectability. I resigned.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-sand/85">
        There was no huge savings account. No investor waiting. Just a decision, a laptop, and an obsession with AI and storytelling.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-sand/85">
        Fear did not disappear, but it moved from the driver’s seat to the passenger seat. It could talk, but it could not steer.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white">Building a Life Around Experiments</h2>
      <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-sand/85">
        Once I was out, there was no magic door that opened. What actually happened was a long series of experiments.
      </p>
      <ul class="space-y-2 text-sm text-sand/85">
        <li>• Running workshops for kids and seniors to show them how to use AI creatively.</li>
        <li>• Turning Palestinian history into visual timelines and songs generated with AI tools.</li>
        <li>• Creating cinematic horror loops for Pinterest boards at 3 a.m.</li>
        <li>• Helping people imagine their ideas as videos, campaigns, or educational content.</li>
        <li>• Prototyping tools and small systems instead of waiting for the “big startup idea”.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-sand/85">
        Many of these experiments did not immediately pay the bills. Some failed completely.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-sand/85">
        But every experiment taught me what people need, what I can do repeatedly without burning out, and where AI can amplify human creativity instead of
        replacing it.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-sand/85">
        I stopped thinking in terms of “career change” and started thinking in terms of a portfolio of attempts.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white">What I’d Tell You If We Were Having Coffee in Ramallah</h2>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">1. Your comfort zone is already costing you something.</h3>
      <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-sand/85">
        Staying where you are feels safe, but it is not neutral. It costs years of potential experiments, skills you could have built, and people you have not
        met yet because you are always too tired after work.
      </p>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">2. You don’t have to jump with no plan, but you do have to move.</h3>
      <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-sand/85">
        I did not randomly resign. I tested ideas at night and on weekends, saw people respond, and noticed real demand.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-sand/85">
        You can start one project that belongs to your future, publish one piece of work a week, and offer one small paid service to test demand.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-sand/85">Fear is allergic to motion. The more you move, the smaller it feels.</p>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">3. Your story is not too small to matter.</h3>
      <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-sand/85">
        I used to think no one would care about a Palestinian guy in Ramallah experimenting with AI tools. Then I saw people react when their own ideas were
        transformed into visuals, songs, and stories.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-sand/85">
        Your context is not a disadvantage. It is your texture. The world does not need another generic success story.
      </p>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">4. You are not late.</h3>
      <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-sand/85">
        AI is moving fast and everyone feels behind, but the truth is simple: everyone is improvising. Some people are just doing it publicly.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white">A Small Invitation</h2>
      <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-sand/85">
        If you remember one thing from this article, let it be this: you don’t have to be ready. You just have to be willing.
      </p>
      <ul class="space-y-2 text-sm text-sand/85">
        <li>• Willing to look silly for a while.</li>
        <li>• Willing to try ideas that might not work.</li>
        <li>• Willing to tell your family you are doing something different and need time.</li>
        <li>• Willing to be a beginner again.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-sand/85">
        I still have uncertainty. I still have worries. I still check my bank account more often than I’d like.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-sand/85">
        But I now wake up with something I did not have before: a sense that my days are connected to who I really am.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-sand/85">
        If you are standing at your own edge, shaking and hesitating, consider this your sign: jump before you feel ready. Your future self is already waiting
        on the other side.
